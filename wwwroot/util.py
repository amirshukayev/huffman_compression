def read_tree(bitreader):
    '''Read a description of a Huffman tree from the given bit reader,
    and construct and return the tree. When this function returns, the
    bit reader should be ready to read the next bit immediately
    following the tree description.

    Huffman trees are stored in the following format:
      * TreeLeaf is represented by the two bits 01, followed by 8 bits
          for the symbol at that leaf.
      * TreeLeaf that is None (the special "end of message" character) 
          is represented by the two bits 00.
      * TreeBranch is represented by the single bit 1, followed by a
          description of the left subtree and then the right subtree.

    Args:
      bitreader: An instance of bitio.BitReader to read the tree from.

    Returns:
      A Huffman tree constructed according to the given description.
